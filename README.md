# ccFBA (Updated November 2024)
Toolbox that performs carbon constraining on constraint-based metabolic models.

Details regarding this toolbox can be found in the following article
"Improving the accuracy of flux balance analysis through the implementation of carbon availability constraints for intracellular reactions"
https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27025

This will be the actively manintained fork for ccFBA/ccFVA until further notice.
